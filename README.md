# Clypper
Clypper is a tool made for youtube streamers to easily download their clips for editing into shorts. This tool was created out of necessity for easily downloading [Cameron Joe @MrEntari](https://www.youtube.com/@MrEntari) clips.

The project contains the following subprojects:
- Clypperlib
- Clypper-gui

## Clypperlib
Clypperlib is a rust library made for easily created new clypper modules. It provides an interface for quickly passing two urls: the clip url and the output file path.

This is still a WIP.

## Clypper-gui
This is a desktop gui for clypper which will provide a full set of features for managing clips including queuing multiple clips.
